h4 Creating a wildly successful blog
p
  | If you care about your career, invest in a blog. Blogs open up lots of opportunity. They also teach you how to write and communicate effectively. Consistency is the most important. Next is quality -- need viewers, subscribers to RSS, and backlinks. Keep brainstorming ideas to write about. To generate ideas, have a conversation or a debate about a topic.
p
  | To grow, start commenting on other people's blogs. When appropriate, link back to your blog. Don't leave spammy comments -- thoughtful comments only. The more thoughtful the more likely they are to look at your blog. Share posts on social networks, put a link to your blog in your email signature and other profiles, make it easy to share articles, make a Call To Action at bottom of post asking readers to share. If bold enough, submit it to Reddit or Hacker News.

  | Commit to keeping your blog up for at least a year. It takes time and commitment to get results. At about the one-year mark is when most people start to see some traction.
